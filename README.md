GoldHabits - Habit Tracking Application

# Project Description
This application will allow users to track their daily habits, set goals, and receive reminders to help them stay motivated. Users will be able to visualize their progress over time using graphs and statistics.

# Key Features
User Account Creation: Secure registration and login.
Adding Habits: Users can add habits they want to track (e.g., drinking water, exercising, reading).
Progress Tracking: Users can mark each habit as completed or not each day.
Reminders: Notifications to remind users to track their habits.
Statistics and Graphs: Visualization of progress over time (e.g., streak graphs, percentage of goals achieved).
Sharing and Motivation: Option to share progress with friends or on social media.
# Technologies
Frontend: Angular for a responsive user interface.
Backend: Spring Boot to manage API requests.
Database: PostgreSQL to store user data and their habits.
Authentication: JWT (JSON Web Tokens) to secure user sessions.
Notifications: Use services like Firebase Cloud Messaging for reminders.
# CI/CD Pipeline
Version Control: Use Git and host the code on GitHub.
Continuous Integration:
Set up unit and integration tests with JUnit or Mockito.
Run tests on each push.
Continuous Deployment:
Deploy the application on a platform like Heroku or Netlify after all tests pass.
Set up notifications for deployment results.
# Tests
Unit Tests: Write tests for each UI component and each API route.
Integration Tests: Ensure that the application works correctly as a whole.
User Interface Tests: Use a tool like Cypress to simulate user interactions.
# Future Improvements
Gamification: Add challenges or rewards to encourage usage.
Integration with Health Apps: Connect the application to services like Google Fit or Apple Health for more accurate tracking.
Data Analysis: Provide recommendations based on user habits.
# Development Plan
Phase 1: Develop the backend (API, database).
Phase 2: Develop the frontend (user interface).
Phase 3: Set up CI/CD and initial deployment.
Phase 4: Testing and adjustments based on user feedback.
This habit tracking application can not only help users achieve their life goals but also offers a great learning opportunity in web development and CI/CD.
